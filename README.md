voxels
======

This was a project made in Unity where I played with the procedural generation
of Zelda-esque landscapes with mountains in the north and ocean in the south a la
Link's Awakening but applied it to voxel-based terrain.

It is based on the [metazelda project](https://github.com/tcoxon/metazelda)
that Tom Coxon used when creating Lenna's Inception. I referenced several articles
that he wrote on overworld generation that appear to have been taken down.
